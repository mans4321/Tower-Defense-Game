Mansour Questions

MAP :
* should the player be able to build their map? or he/she can pick a map from set of maps have different characteristic such size and the location of entry/exit point?

*If the player creates map that map has to be validity However if the player just be allowed to pick a map validating a map would not be necessary (because any map that we would build we just have to code it in a way that apply the conditions of a valid map)


Critters :

*the strength and speed of Critters increase every level. therefore the strength and speed are characteristics of the game(in another word the characteristic of each level ) not the Critters.

  -what the characters of Critters should be ? // I tried   similar games and the characterizes of Critters are speed,strength, and         compassion of both ( fast but weak , slow but strong, etc).
