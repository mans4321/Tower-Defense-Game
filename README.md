# Map Editor:
## Environment:
 - Jetbeans Intellij 
    - We can just simply use "src", "res", "saved" directory in this project and add Java 1.8SE, GSON external library to migrate to          Eclipse.


## Done:
  - User can choose map size and entrance cell, exit cell to the map.
  - It can save maps to a json file and can be retrived. (We use Gson library).
  - User can select maps shown in thumbnail retrived from Json file to start a new game.
  

## ToDo:
 - Add an algorithm to decide if this map is validate to use (e.g. not a circle or path is too short).
 - The UI is not even close to be fancy, it's ugly. We can improve it by adding some background pictures, etc.;
 - Maybe we can reset some variables to make it more like a real game.
